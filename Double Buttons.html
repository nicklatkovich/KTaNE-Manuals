                <h2>On the Subject of Double Buttons</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">There are two buttons: ON and ON...</p>
                <p>
                    The module has LEDs. Each LED is connected to exactly two buttons. Pressing either of the two buttons will turn on the LED.
                    The module will be solved when all LEDs turn on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buttons can be mono-color or two-color. For each color there is a limit on the number of button presses with that color.
                    Pressing a mono-colored button counts as two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are six colors in total: red, green, blue, cyan, magenta and yellow.
                    The number of remaining presses for the five colors is displayed on the dials on the right side of the module.
                    For one color, the limit is not displayed, but it still exists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there are no buttons available for pressing or a button was pressed that exceeded the hidden limit,
                    then you will receive a strike, and the module will reset.
