                    If Hilbert rented out an infinite number of rooms every day for an infinite amount of money for an infinite amount of time,
                    could he keep his money in an infinitely huge wallet? :Thonk:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Hilbert Hotel has an infinite number of rooms. An infinite number of maids are needed to serve them.
                    Each maid is assigned a number that shows the range of rooms that are assigned to her.
                    The first maid is assigned rooms 1-700, the second - 701-1400, and so on.
                    Also, the maids clean the rooms depending on the day: on Monday they clean the first 100 rooms from their range, on Tuesday the next 100 rooms, and so on.
                    Every day, one new maid is hired, who is assigned a number from 1 to 100,
                    and the numbers of maids whose number is greater than or equal to the number of the new maid are shifted one up.
                    Starting from the second day, each maid herself determines the rooms in which she must clean.
                    But every day the new maid needs to give the keys to the rooms, which she must clean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 12 numbered rooms keys hanging on the module.
                    On the right side of the module is a paper on which is written the number of the new maid, a form with requests for cleaning and a bell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Press the room key to give it to the new maid. A new set of 12 rooms keys will appear on the module.
                    If a room does not have to be cleaned by the new maid today, or there is no request to clean that room, you will receive a strike.
                </p>
                <p>Press the bell if all the necessary keys have been issued.</p>
                <p>
                    To view the cleaning request form, press it. It will open to the entire module. Press it again to close it.
                    It contains all cleaning requests for the last 7 days.
                    The number of requests is infinite, but every day all numbers of rooms requested for cleaning are described by a formula.
                    Examples of such formulas:
                    <ul>
                        <li>87*n</li>
                        <li>69*n + 4</li>
                        <li>7*n^2 + 31</li>
                        <li>8*n^2 + 61*n + 35</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
