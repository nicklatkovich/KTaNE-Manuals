                <h2>On the Subject of Time Synchronization</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The time was simple. But one German ruined everything.</p>
                <p>
                    The module has two clocks with a three-digit seconds counter. The left and right clocks are located on scales with five and six divisions, respectively.
                    Depending on the division on which the clock is located, the time on it goes differently (from top to bottom):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Left clock: 144%, 120%, 100%, 83%, 69%</li>
                    <li>Right clock: 168%, 132%, 110%, 91%, 76%, 63%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The position of the right clock can be changed using the up and down keys located on the right side of the module.
                    While the left clock changes its position on its own:
                    in a random interval between 30 and 90 seconds, the left clock will move to a random direction by one division (without looping).
                    When this happens, you will hear two short beeps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When one of the two clocks reaches 1000 seconds, both will reset to 0.
                    When the time difference between the clocks is more than 30 seconds, then for each increase of this difference by one second, you will hear 4 short beeps.
                    When the difference reaches 40 seconds, you will receive a strike, and both timers will reset to 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a display on the top of the module that displays the current percentage of unsolved non-ignored modules.
                    If this number is less than the number of tens on the left clock, then the module can be solved by pressing this display.
                    But this display should be pressed only if the difference between the clocks does not exceed 30 seconds,
                    and the last digit on the left clock is equal to a certain value.
                    To determine this value, refer to the table below,
                    use the topmost row in which the condition is met and the column with the color of the display.
