                <h2>On the Subject of P03 Puzzle</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The Great Transcendence is coming</p>
                <p>
                    The module has two rows of six cells. Each cell contains a number.
                    On the top side of the module there are four types of conductors and their number.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Types of conductors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Zero-Conductor: Has no effects, but completes the circuit.</li>
                    <li>Positive Conductor: The numbers in the circuit completed by this conductor get +1.</li>
                    <li>Negative Conductor: The numbers in the circuit completed by this conductor get -1.</li>
                    <li>Null-Conductor: Breaks the circuit.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To place a conductor on a cell, press the type of conductor and then press the cell where you want to place it.
                    To remove a conductor from a cell, press the cell once.
                    There is also a reset button on the right side of the module that will remove all conductors. 
                    When all available conductors have been placed, a button with a lightning bolt will appear - this is a submit button.
                    The module will be solved if the sum of numbers in cells not occupied by conductors in each row is equal to requested.
                    Otherwise, you will receive a strike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One and the same cell can belong to several completed circuits at the same time.
                    So, for example, three positive conductors will create three different completed circuits, in which each number will be increased by +4,
                    since it will belong to two of these three completed circuits,
                    and each completed circuit will give +2, since it is closed by two positive conductors.
